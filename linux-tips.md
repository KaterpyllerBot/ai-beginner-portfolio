# Linux Tips for AI🐧 

These are my notes and commands I'm learning to use Linux for AI development.

## Useful Commands
- `ls` – Show files in the current folder
- `cd folder_name` – Change to a different folder
- `python hello-ai.py` – Run a Python script
- `pip install package_name` – Install Python packages

## Tips for AI Work
- Python is easier on Linux
- Jupyter Notebooks run well in Linux
- Docker (later on) helps with AI environments

I'll keep updating this as I learn more!
